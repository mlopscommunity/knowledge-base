Welcome to the community-based MLOps Knowledge Base. All contributions are highly appreciated. However, we want this knowledge base to be as neutral and well-organised as possible, thus there are several hints for contributors.

1. If you want to add or update a page, please make a PR. In this PR, add a short description of your change or reference a corresponding issue (see [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/mlopscommunity/projects/5) for a list of open issues).
2. Please note that this knowledge base is hosted by GitBook at [this url](https://mariyadavydova.gitbook.io/mlops/). Thus, every page should follow some requirements:
    1. Each page should be in Markdown (GitHub flavour).
    2. If you add a new page, please donâ€™t forget to add it in [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/mlopscommunity/knowledge-base/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).
    3. If you add some graphics, please put them in `.gitbook/assets` folder.
3. We are international community with a lot of people for whom English is not a mother tongue. Please keep your language clean and understandable by people with intermediate level of language.
